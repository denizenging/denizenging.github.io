Hello there! I am an undergraduate of linguistics at the Medeniyet University of Ä°stanbul who is a well-seasoned programmer, too!

I am 22 years old and I like programming, sharing my knowledge, and of course music! My interests include computational linguistics, phonology, cognitive linguistics. I program mainly using the Web stack, but I do enjoy low-level programming and cryptography.

You can find me at your local social media platform using #link("/page/links")[the links page].
