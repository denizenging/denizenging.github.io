== On Sharing
Writing has been a deeply cherished dream of mine for the past few
years. Not the act of writing, per se, but rather the notion that I can
share the insights and experiences from my humble life, however humble
it may be.

Sharing valuable insights from life is the most virtuous of all acts,
in my opinion. One can gain so much from others' experiences, including
their mistakes. As human beings, we simply aren't capable of making all
the errors out there---some mistakes are not accessible to us. Do you
remember seniors telling you the first heartbreak you experienced wasn't
going to be the last one? They are talking from experience, from their
own mistakes which you weren't able to make at the time.

Reading and learning from the mistakes of others is far more
approachable. However, this does not necessarily mean that we shouldn't
experience any mistakes in life on our own. On the contrary, some
mistakes offer us more beneficial insights if we make them ourselves.
Recall the heartbreak example above. If you weren't emotionally attached
in this instance, you wouldn't appreciate your lover (or the next) as
much as you would otherwise.

One other reason why the act of sharing is truly invaluable relates to
time. Time is the essense of everything, and in the western culture,
it is often thought to be more precious than money is. This view is very
well justified, in my opinion---we all are given one life in this world.
And we could leave life in any moment. No one can assert, with
certainity, that they will live to see another day. For that very
reason, every minute you spend on earth is priceless. And by sharing my
findings and notes, I will benefit you with more time to yourselves.

== On Writing
As rather simplistic primates, who heavily rely on sugar to function, we
often tend to forget things, especically if we are hungry. Jerome
K.~Jerome has a really good quote on this in his _Three Men in a Boat_:

#quote(block: true, attribution: "Jerome K. Jerome")[
	It is very strange, this domination of our intellect by our
	digestive organs. We cannot work, we cannot think, unless our
	stomach wills so. It dictates to us our emotions, our passions.
]

That is the reason why the act of writing is quite precious to us, as
often brought up by my dear professor and advisor, #[Fırat Başbuğ], to
whom I am really grateful for. In Turkish, we even have a great saying
about this: #tr["Söz uçar, yazı kalır,"] the English equivalent of which
is "The palest ink is stronger than the sharpest memory," which I am
quite found of as well.

One, for sure, could keep a private notebook about one's own
reflections. In my worldview, however, access to education and knowledge
must be made available to anyone free of charge. And that brings us to
the creation of this site. And... here we are.

So, I welcome you, my dear readers and future self to the depths of my
mind, written from the bottom of my generous heart.
